5. Agreements between Users of Our Sites
Our Sites allow property owners and managers to advertise their properties (each, an “Advertiser“) to potential student tenants (each, a “Student“).
You may use the Sites as a guest user or a registered user. Once you have discovered a property that best suits your needs, you can make an enquiry and complete the booking request form. The booking request form includes your name, email address, phone number and information concerning the length of stay. No payment details are required at this stage and there is no commitment to rent a room. Your allocated booking consultant will then contact you to confirm and discuss the accommodation type that you require. Contact may be made via messaging systems including Whatsapp, Wechat, QQ, etc.
We do not own or manage, nor do we contract for, any rental property listed on our Sites. We will not be a party to any agreement between an Advertiser and a Student. The terms of any agreement entered into between an Advertiser and a Student may vary from Advertiser to Advertiser. It is your responsibility to review and agree to an Advertiser’s specific terms including the Advertiser’s terms relating to payments and cancellations where payment is made via our Sites. All aspects of a transaction between a Student and an Advertiser, including (but not limited to) the quality, condition, safety or legality of the properties advertised and the ability of a user to enter into a transaction are solely the responsibility of each user. This includes the terms of any security deposit, which are set by the Advertiser. We do not represent, or negotiate, or carry out research on the part of or act on behalf of either Advertisers or Students.
We do not accept any responsibility for the confirmation of a Student and/or Advertiser’s identity.  Where a third party (for example an education or travel agent) acts on a Student’s behalf, it is the Student’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the information provided by the third party. We encourage users to take all such steps as necessary to communicate directly with a Student/Advertiser (as applicable) to assure yourself of the other person’s identity, details of the property and any tenancy agreement.
6. Prices
The prices of properties displayed on the Sites are liable to change at any time. Despite our best efforts, some of the prices listed on the Sites may be incorrect. We expressly reserve the right to correct any pricing errors on our Sites and/or on potential bookings which have not yet been completed.
We display the prices that Advertisers provide to us from time to time. We are not responsible or liable for the accuracy of the prices displayed, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
Due to the international nature of our Sites, the currency of the prices shown may vary depending on your location. Currency rates given on the Sites are based on various publicly available sources and should be used as guidelines only. Rates are not verified as accurate and actual prices may vary from those shown on the Sites.
From time to time, third parties may list promotions, special offers or other forms of coupon on our Sites (“Coupons”). Coupons will contain terms and conditions that will apply in addition to these Terms, and will be void if you attempt to redeem the Coupon in violation of either these Terms or the terms of the Coupon. Unless expressly stated on the Coupon, it may not be used in combination with other promotions or discounts. Coupons are only redeemable during the promotional period specified in the Coupon, subject to availability. These Coupons will be non-transferable and have no alternative cash value.
7.Payments
Any booking of accommodation with a Property Manager will be subject to either the Standard Payment Process or the Contact Property Manager Payment Process – both as set out below. When you make a booking of accommodation through Paytrix.com, you will be made aware of which payment process applies to the relevant property.
7.1 Standard Payment Process
7.1.1 In some circumstances, you can make payments to Advertisers via our Sites using payment providers such as Stripe, Alipay, WeChat etc. You can find out more about Stripe here. You can find out more about Alipay here. In such circumstances, it remains your responsibility to make yourself aware of the Property Manager’s booking and cancellation policies. Any deposit paid to a Property Manager via our Site is held by the Property Manager not by Paytrix.com. At the end of a rental agreement, you must contact the Property Manager to obtain the return of your deposit.
7.2 Contact Property Manager Payment Process
7.2.1 The first instalment of rent and any security deposit payable by you to a Property Manager pursuant to a rental agreement entered into between you and a Property Manager, together with the transaction fee payable by you to us,  shall be paid to us via our Sites when the Property Manager confirms acceptance of the booking using the payment providers Stripe, Alipay, WeChat etc. You can find out more about Stripe here. You can find out more about Alipay here. However, IT REMAINS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE YOURSELF AWARE OF THE PROPERT MANAGER’S BOOKING AND CANCELLATION POLICIES AND THE ADVERTISER’S RENTAL AGREEMENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
7.2.2 Where you request a refund via Stripe, in accordance with Stripe’s refund policy, it may take up to two weeks to receive the refund.
7.2.3 Upon receipt of any security deposit from you in respect of a rental agreement entered into between you and a Property Manager, we will hold such security deposit until either (i) you cancel your rental agreement with the Property Manager in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Property Manager, at which stage we will, within five (5) to seven (7) working days of  you cancelling your rental agreement,  return to you such security deposit together with the first instalment of rent you have paid to us; or (ii) the period during which you may cancel your agreement with the Property Manager in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Property Manager has expired, at which stage, if you have not cancelled your rental agreement with the Property Manager within that period, we will remit such security deposit to the Property Manager. Please note that we will retain the transaction fee you pay to us even if you cancel your rental agreement in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Property Manager.
7.2.4 If you cancel a rental agreement with a  Property Manager outside the period permitted in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Property Manager, you will have to seek to recover any security deposit you may have paid and we will pay to the Property Manager the first instalment of rent you paid to us (having deducted, with the agreement of the Property Manager, the fee payable by the Advertiser to us in respect of your rental agreement). PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE PROPERTY MANAGER MAY SEEK TO RECOVER FROM YOU ALL FURTHER AMOUNTS OF RENT PAYABLE UNDER THE RENTAL AGREEMENT.
7.2.5 To the extent required by any relevant legislation, it is the responsibility of the Property Manager to protect any security deposit you have paid in connection with any rental agreement entered into between you and a Property Manager.
7.2.6 At the end of your rental agreement with a Property Manager, you must contact the Property Manager to obtain the return of your security deposit, subject to such deductions the Property Manager may be permitted to make from the security deposit in accordance with the terms of your rental agreement.
7.2.7 Within forty-eight (48) hours of the relevant Property Manager confirming to us that you have moved-in to a property pursuant to a rental agreement entered into between you and the Property Manager, we will pay to the Property Manager the first instalment of the rent you have paid to us (having deducted, with the agreement of the Property Manager, the fee payable by the Property Manager to us in respect of your rental agreement).
7.2.8 All subsequent payments of rent due to the Property Manager are to be paid directly by you to the Property Manager, or as the Property Manager may direct. Similarly, any Administration and/or Application Fees are payable direct to the Property manager (or as the Property Manager may direct).
7.2.9 If, for whatever reason, you do not move-in to the relevant property within two (2) days of the occupational start date under your rental agreement with the Property Manager (which rental agreement you have not previously cancelled), and you have not previously informed the  Property Manager that you will be moving into the property at a later date, you will be deemed to have cancelled your rental agreement and the provisions of paragraph 7.2.4 above will apply.
8. Charges and Cancellations
8.1 Any rental agreement entered into will be between a Student and a Property Manager. It is the Student’s responsibility to make themselves aware of the Property Manager’s cancellation policy and rental agreement terms and conditions at the time of booking.
8.2 If you have booked using the Standard Payment Process and you need to cancel a rental agreement with a Property Manager, you should contact your Paytrix.com booking agent who will liaise with the Property Manager. Your booking agent will advise you of what amount(s) (if any), will remain owing to the Property Manager. Any refunds due to you from the Property Manager will be the responsibility of the Property Manager and will be made directly to you.
8.3 If you have booked using the Contact Property Manager Payment Process and  you need to cancel  a rental agreement with a Property Manager prior to the occupational start date under your rental agreement, you may only do so via our Sites. Please see paragraph 7.2.4 above for an explanation of the consequences should you cancel a rental agreement with a Property Manager outside the period permitted in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Property Manager.
If you have booked using the Contact Property Manager Payment Process and you wish to change (but not cancel), a rental agreement with a Property Manager prior to the occupational start date under your rental agreement, please contact [                         ] to discuss the possibility of making the change you would like to make.
